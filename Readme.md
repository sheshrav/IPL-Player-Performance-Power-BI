# IPL Data PowerBI Dashboard
# Overview
This folder features a PowerBI dashboard presenting comprehensive insights into Indian Premier League (IPL) data spanning from 2008 to 2022. Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, I utilized PowerBI to craft an interactive dashboard that categorizes players into bowlers and batsmen, offering a holistic view of the overall performance.

# Features
Data Grouping: Employed Python to group the IPL data based on overall statistics, categorizing players into bowlers and batsmen for a clearer understanding of their performance.

Interactive Dashboard: Utilized PowerBI's capabilities to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard, enabling users to explore and analyze IPL data dynamically.
